This weekâ€™s talk will be given by [Rajesh](https://rajeshrinet.github.io/).  
He will discuss how stochastic differential equations can be used to model systems with distinct dynamics and time scales. Some case studies will also be presented and he will discuss some algorithms to deal with such equations numerically.



## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Saturday (Setember 09, 2017), 2 PM  
**Venue:** 326/327
