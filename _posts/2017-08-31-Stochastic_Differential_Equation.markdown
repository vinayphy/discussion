This week's talk will be given by Rishu Kumar Singh. He will be discussing about ways
of handling Stochastic differential equations and performing their
numerical simulations to obtain stochastic trajectories.



## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Saturday (Setember 02, 2017), 2 PM  
**Venue:** 326/327
