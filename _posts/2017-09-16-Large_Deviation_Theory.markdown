In the next talk, we will discuss a basic introduction to large deviation
theory and its application to Markov process. The talk will be
given by [Rajesh](https://rajeshrinet.github.io/).  


We will also have a quick review of previous talks to contextualize our
discussion and plan the upcoming talks.
