# A Dicussion Group of Graduate Students at IMSc

This page contains the details that come out of the discussions held almost each week on Saturday at IMSc Chennai. A group of graduate students, primarily from Physics and Computational Biology, participate in the discussion.

## Present Discussion Topic: 
* ***Stochastic Thermodynamics***
